Rediffbol-prpl

--------
OVERVIEW
--------

Rediffbol is an IM service used by some people in India.

Rediffbol-prpl is a Rediffbol protocol-plugin for libpurple, used by
IM-clients such as Pidgin and Adium.
 
-----------------------
BUILDING AND INSTALLING
-----------------------

Rediffbol-prpl now uses the standard GNU build system. 

First make sure you have the development files for libpurple installed.
You could either have got this by installing from source or installing
the respective package. E.g. in ubuntu do 
    sudo apt-get install libpurple-dev

rediffbol-prpl requires libpurple >= 2.3.0. 

To build just run :
	./configure && make && sudo make install 
To uninstall just run
	sudo make uninstall

It is possible to install the plugin _without_ administrative permissions.
For this do
	./configure && make && make install-exec-local


Windows: I am pretty confident its possible to build this for Windows
too, but you'll have to do some hacking to the Makefile. Since I
don't use Windows, I can't do this myself. Send me whatever is required
if you manage to do it :)
