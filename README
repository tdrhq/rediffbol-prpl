Rediffbol-prpl is a Rediffbol protocol-plugin for libpurple, used by
IM-clients such as Pidgin and Adium.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
-----------------------

First make sure you have the development files for libpurple installed.
You could either have got this by installing from source or installing
the respective package. E.g. in ubuntu do 
    sudo apt-get install libpurple-dev

rediffbol-prpl requires libpurple >= 2.3.0. If you get a compile error
that says PURPLE_CONNECTION_ERROR_NETWORK_ERROR is not defined, then the
likely cause is an old version of libpurple-dev. 

To build just type "make" followed by "make install" (You don't have to
do "sudo make install"). 

Windows: I am pretty confident its possible to build this for Windows
too, but you'll have to do some hacking to the Makefile. Since I
don't use Windows, I can't do this myself. Send me whatever is required
if you manage to do it :)
